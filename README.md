# 🔄 Customer Churn Analysis – Hackathon Project

A machine learning and analytics project focused on predicting telecom customer churn and uncovering key patterns using data science techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Description

**Customer Churn Analysis** is a data-driven hackathon project aimed at analyzing a telecom customer dataset to predict which customers are likely to churn. The goal was to extract actionable business insights using machine learning models, visualizations, and exploratory data analysis.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- ✅ **Churn Prediction Model** using Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers
- 📊 **Power BI Dashboards** to visualize customer behavior and churn metrics
- 🧼 **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing** including Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Missing Value Imputation
- 📈 Achieved **85%+ accuracy** using Random Forest, enabling informed decisions on customer retention

---

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- **Power BI** for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and experimentation

---

## ⚙️ Workflow Summary

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
   - Handled missing values using `SimpleImputer`
   - Applied `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder` to transform categorical variables

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Explored trends in churn using visualizations (bar plots, heatmaps, etc.)
   - Identified correlations and key business drivers

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained and evaluated **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**
   - Selected Random Forest as the best-performing model based on accuracy (~85%)

4. **Visualization & Reporting**
   - Created **Power BI dashboards** to present churn insights to stakeholders
